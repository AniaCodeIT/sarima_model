# Google Stock Price Prediction with ARIMA and SARIMA
This project was developed as part of a university class to demonstrate time series forecasting techniques using Python. The focus was on applying ARIMA and SARIMA models to predict Google's stock prices, showcasing how these statistical models can be used for financial forecasting.

## Project Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of financial markets. In this project, we leveraged:

ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): A fundamental time series forecasting method.

SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): An extension of ARIMA that incorporates seasonality into the model.
## Features
Historical stock price data analysis.
ARIMA and SARIMA model fitting and parameter optimization.
Forecast visualization with confidence intervals.
Comparative evaluation of model performance.
## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
### Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation

numpy for numerical computations

matplotlib for data visualization

statsmodels for implementing ARIMA and SARIMA models
